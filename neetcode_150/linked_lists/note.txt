# singly linked list
- sequential access
- made up of listnodes
- listnode: value, next pointer (to next listnode)
- these are not contiguous cells in memory
- insertion is o(1) when we know the insertion point

Big Oh notation:
access: o(n), bc it is sequential access, unless accessing head and tail stored which is o(1)
search: o(n)
insert: - insertion is o(1) when we know the insertion point (aka dont need to search via val constraint)
delete: - deletion is o(1) when we know the deletion point (aka dont need to search via val constraint)
