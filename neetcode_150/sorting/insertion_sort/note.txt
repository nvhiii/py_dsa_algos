# insertion sort
# pseudo

for i in range(1, len(arr)):
    j = i - 1 # prev index
    while j >= 0 and arr[j + 1] < arr[j]: # not adding <= to second cond makes this a stable sorting algo
        temp = arr[j + 1] # next item is stored curr
        arr[j + 1] = arr[j] # swap indices
        arr[j] = temp
        j -= 1

time complexity
# best case: o(n)
# worst case: o(n ^ 2)

space complexity
o(1) bc it is a in-place sorting algo, no additional ds needed
