Graphs

- Graphs are made up of nodes and edges

Terms:
- Vertice: A node in a Graphs
- Edge: Connect node to node
- Directed graph: edges have arrows
    * have pointers (e.g. linked list, trees)
- Undirected graph: edges have no arrows

V = Vertice
E = edge

E <= V^2 always

Types of Graphs:
1. matrix   
    space: n * m (n cols and m rows)
2. adjacency matrix
    space: V^2 since matrix must have vertice by vertice dimensions
3. adjacency list
    space: V + E

Matrix DFS:

- uses recusion

(my explanation): so my understanding is that count is first 0, then we have the base case checking, then we find next valid spot starting down, up, right, left. Then if it is valid, we call dfs on that specific row and col val of the grid, then we keep going on the specific set of recursive calls until we get to valid end, which is [3][3] in this case. Then we reached the base case for valid, then return 1. Then we backtrack using remove on the visited, until we find another index in the matrix that can give us a possible route. (this possible route is found by iterating the recursive calls via dfs again on the backtracked index, then finding a valid index on bottom, top, right, left. This is usually dependent on if one of the other dfs recursive cases were added to stack, so we skipped the later recursive call. Then we keep doing this backtracking, until we return all the way back to [0][0], correct?
Time complexity:
    - depends on movement in graph
    - Ex: O((Num Movements)^n * m) # 4 directional = 4^nm, 8 directional = 8^nm, etc
Space:
    - O(n * m) # depends on size of recursion stack (n * m) and size of hashset, (n * m)

Matrix BFS:

- uses iteration
- used to find shortest path
    Q: Why?
    A: because unlike DFS, which goes all the way down a specific path first, BFS goes layer by layer
        By layer by layer (this means the directions around the curr matrix index), the queue is appended
        the indices surrounding the current index in the matrix, and we first iterate those before going to next
        layer. Hence, we do not make the mistake of going down an invalid path

Time Complexity:
    - O (n * m) worst case visited all coord
Space:
    - O(n * m) bc queue n * m vertices or hashset n * m vertices
