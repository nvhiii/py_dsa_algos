Adjacency list
- can be implemented as a graph like so:
class GraphNode:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = []

common way to do it using hashmap:
adj_list = { "A": [], "B": []}, etc

Q: how to build adj list given directed edges?

directed edges = {["a": "b"], etc...}

    for n, dst in edges:
        if n not in adjlist:
            adjlist[n] = []
        if dst not in adjlist:
            adjlist[dst] = []
        adjlist[n].append(dst)
    visited.add(node)

DFS on an Adjacency list
1. base case
dfs(node, target, adjlist, visit):
    if node in visit:
        return 0
    if node == target:
        return 1

    visit.add(node)
    for neighbor in
