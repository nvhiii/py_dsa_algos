# input is size of "n", time space size

# constant: O(1)
# logarithmic: O(logn) / base 2 implied
# linear: O(n)
# nlogn: O(nlogn)
# quadratic: O(n^2) / largest exp is 2nd power
# cubic (polynomial): O(n^3) or depends on the exponent
# exponential: O(a^n)

# run time of algo is the number of operations performed

# big o(rder) notation
# f(n) is big-Oh of g(n)
# f(n) is order of g(n)

# big omega to compare if function is less or greater than one another
# f(n) is big-Omega of g(n)

# big theta to compare equality 
# f(n) is big-Theta of g(n)
