# input is size of "n", time space size

# constant: O(1)
# logarithmic: O(logn) / base 2 implied
# linear: O(n)
# nlogn: O(nlogn)
# quadratic: O(n^2) / largest exp is 2nd power
# cubic (polynomial): O(n^3) or depends on the exponent
# exponential: O(a^n)

# run time of algo is the number of operations performed

# big o(rder) notation
# f(n) is big-Oh of g(n)
# f(n) is order of g(n)

# big omega to compare if function is less or greater than one another
# f(n) is big-Omega of g(n)

# big theta to compare equality 
# f(n) is big-Theta of g(n)

# justification techniques

# counter example
# prove by providing an example that contradicts

# contrapositive
# if p then q turns into if not q then not p (complete negation proof)

# contradiction
# given a statement, assume the opposite first then prove it

# induction
# involves proving base case then inductive case (basically recursive case)

# loop invariant
# invariant is the condition for ensuring truth of loop iteration, maintains and then terminates
