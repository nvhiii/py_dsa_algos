# arrays
# dyanmic arrays (list)
# compact arrays (array.array)

# Compact Arrays:
- They have fixed size
- Each item in the list should take same amount of space (memory) // hence, array.array() constructor has 2 param, the identifier in first index, and the set list size as the second
- this is the same for tuples
- to calculate approx mem address
- do start (memory cell) + cell_size * index

# Dynamic Arrays (lists + tuples):
- represent array of obj references
