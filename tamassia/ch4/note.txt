# recursion

# recognized by distinct base and recursive case

# illustrated
# factorial
# english ruler

# linear recursion only 1 recur case
# binary recusion 2 recur cases
# multiple recursion more than 2 recur cases

# basically, space complexity = highest power of space needed (n element array ex, etc)
# time complexity = highest power of operations that need to be executed
