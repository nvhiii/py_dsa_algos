hash implementation steps:

(1 to 3) must be O(1) time
1. access while self.map[index] != None
2. insert while true
3. delete while true

4. Hash function
5. Rehash (resizing)

Important notes:
    
Noob hash fxn:
1. Calculate ordinal val of each chara in string then divvy by
the capacity of the arr (for string only)

Rehashing tip:
1. resize capacity by factor of 2 (for more specialization, find double and then next prime actually for less collisions)
2. new arr
3. populate arr by iterating range of capacity, append None
4. store the curr map in a temp var
5. set map var to new arr
6. iter the pairs from the temp then append using insert method
