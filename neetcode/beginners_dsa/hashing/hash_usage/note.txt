Hash Usage

- set: contains only keys
- map: contains keys + values

- both cannot have duplicate keys though!

- treemap v. hashmap

treemap:
insert o(logn)
delete o(logn)
access o(logn)
traverse o(n)

hashmap:
insert o(1)
delete o(1)
access o(1)
cannot traverse, need a sort algo, nlogn
