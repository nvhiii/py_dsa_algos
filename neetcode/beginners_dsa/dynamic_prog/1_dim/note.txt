1 Dimension dynamic Programming

- Basically optimized recursion
- break down large problems into smaller problems
- solve these smaller problems, but optimize (memoization / caching / tabulation)
- reach base case
- solution is optimal

Two Types of 1 Dimension Dynamic Programming
- Top Down
    other names:
        memoization + caching
    top down = top down iteration of a recursive tree, but also efficient
                storing. This is to reach base case efficiently

- Bottom up
    other names:
        tabulation
    bottom up = bottom up iteration, starting from base case + unique storing solution, usually o(1) storing
