# BST Sets and Maps

- sets and maps can be implemented through BST
- access, insert, delete all o(logn) time then
- python needs import

    pseudo:
        from sortedcontainers import SortedDict

Sets:
- allow for only unique vals
Trees:
- ensure order
Therefore, trees + sets = treeset, no dupes + in order = o(logn)

Maps:
- key value pair
Tree + Map = treemap
