binary search tree (BST)

- have sorted aspect of binary tree
- left child is less than parent
- right child is more than parent
- assume the tree is balanced, so we can get logn
- worst case (if unbalanced), is basically a singly linked list time
    that time is O(n) or O(h), where h is height

Q: Why use over arrays?
A:
This allows for insert and delete faster than arr, where list is o(n), and this is o(logn)
