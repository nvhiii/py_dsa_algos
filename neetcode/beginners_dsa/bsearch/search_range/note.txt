when we have to implement a binary search without a target to compare to but
only a range

1. We usually have another method to "define" correctness, e.g. isCorrect, etc.

we use this correctness function within the binary search itself

example pseudo:

    method signature(l, r):

        while l <= r:
            mi = l + (r - l) // 2

            if helper(mi) > 0:
                r = mi - 1
            elif helper(mi) < 0:
                l = mi + 1
            else:
                return mi

    # in this example, helper is our method to define correctness!
