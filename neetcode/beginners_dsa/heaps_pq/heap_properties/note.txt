# Heaps / Priority Queues

Structure:
    - must be a complete binary tree, meaning no levels
    aside the last lvl can have null values
    - Basically, no holes until last level

Order:
    - Min vs Max property Priority

    For Min Heap:
    - recursively, all descendants should be greater than 
    or equal to root node
    
    For Max Heap:
    - recursively, all descendants should be less than
    or equal to root node

Visualization of a heap is via a tree, but under the hood
is an array

How the heap array is constructed:
- 0th index is skipped (to calculate and percolate between elements)
- How to calculate the nodes:
    leftChild = 2 * index
    rightChild = 2 * index + 1
    parent = index // 2 (round down)

    ** CALCULATION ONLY VALID IF WE HAVE A COMPLETE BINARY TREE
