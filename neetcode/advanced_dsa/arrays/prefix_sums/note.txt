Prefix Sums

1. calc prefix or postfix constraint arr first, only calculated once, so o(n) space is omitted
2. then iterate until we fulfill the result to return constraint problem

arr = []
total = 0
for n in arr:
    total += n # can be any operation
    arr.append(total)

# then we can freely calc the sum diff prod quotient, etc
