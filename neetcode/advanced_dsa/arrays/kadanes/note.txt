Kadane's Algo

* (a subarray is defined by contiguous elements in arr)
* also make sure to check if output has to be based on non-empty arr!
* when all elements in arr is positive, this means that the max is the entire arr
* always try to avoid negative sum subarray

- "find the max sum of a subarray given an arr"
or
- "find the indices of the last and first index of the subarray which yields max sum in the arr"
or
- "return the subarr which yields the max sum in the arr"

pseudo (to find the max sum):
# very similar to finding max or min in an arr actually!

maxSum = first index of arr

iterate the elements in given arr
for num in nums:
    initialize currSum, and check if it is nonnegative from prev iter if applicable
    currSum = max(currSum, 0)
    add the new num to currSum
    currSum += num
    # update max as needed
    maxSum = max(maxSum, currSum)

return maxSum # gives us the max sum of a subarray within the given arr

pseudo (to find the left and right indices of the max sum subarr in arr)

initialization of variables:
maxSum = 0th index of arr val
currSum = 0
maxL, maxR = 0, 0 # these are the pointers we will update for the max subarr start + end indices
L = 0 # this is the pointer for the left index in the arr

for R in range(len(nums)): # R represents the right bound
    # now do a check on the currSum if nonnegative
    if currSum < 0:
        currSum = 0
        L = R # move the pointer, to skip the negative number, the prev index doesnt matter to us

    # add the num in the curr index to currSum
    currSum += nums[R]
    # do a check with max
    if currSum > maxSum:
        maxSum = currSum
        maxL, maxR = L, R

return L, R

time complexity: o(n), 1 pass through the nums arr
space: o(1), we arent using extra ds, and only a handful of variables needed.
